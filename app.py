    Implementation of a DNN prediction model to determine whether clients of a banking institution will subscribe to a bank term deposit or not. The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
    These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, several contacts with the same client were necessary to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed to ("yes") or not ("no"). The current model takes into account 20 features from each client. 
    The model was developed with a base of 45,307 different clients. </div>
